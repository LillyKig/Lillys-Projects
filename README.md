In my masters, I have honed the following skills and this repository are some of the projects I did. They include the below processes:
•	Data Collection: I have extensive experience gathering data from diverse sources, including databases and APIs, ensuring that the data is accurate, complete, and structured for seamless analysis.
•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: I excel at cleaning and preprocessing data to remove inconsistencies, duplicates, and errors using Python. This process ensures that datasets are primed for accurate and insightful analysis.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis: I utilize statistical techniques and data visualization tools to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), allowing me to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within data. I am proficient in both univariate and bivariate analysis, which provides a comprehensive understanding of the data at hand.
•	Model Building and Machine Learning: I have a strong foundation in building machine learning models and implementing algorithms to predict outcomes, classify data, or make recommendations. I have worked with a range of algorithms, including linear and logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines (SVM), decision tree classifiers, random forests, k-means clustering, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA). I am skilled in selecting the appropriate algorithm, training, testing, and fine-tuning models to achieve optimal performance.
•	Data Visualization: I am adept at communicating complex data findings to non-technical stakeholders through clear and impactful visualizations. I use tools like Matplotlib, ggplot, Tableau, and Power BI to create intuitive and informative charts, graphs, and dashboards that support decision-making.
•	Business Strategy and Decision Making:I provide actionable insights and recommendations based on data analysis, driving informed decision-making that aligns with strategic objectives.
